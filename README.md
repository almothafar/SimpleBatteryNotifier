# 📱 SimpleBatteryNotifier

A lightweight Android app to keep you informed about your battery status — without heavy resource usage or unnecessary “power saver” bloat.

## 💡 Why SimpleBatteryNotifier?
Ever been busy at work or home and suddenly realized your phone is almost out of battery?  
Or worse — your phone dies while you’re traveling and you can’t recharge it.

Unlike heavy battery saver apps (which Android doesn’t actually need), SimpleBatteryNotifier is designed to:
- Monitor your battery efficiently
- Send you timely notifications
- Avoid slowing down your phone or draining your resources

No surprises. No clutter. Just simple battery notifications.
